# jquery-DOMwindow

Originally found at http://swip.codylindley.com/, this plugin allows for easy creation of a variety of modal pop-ups
using just jQuery. The differences from the original code are as follows:

- Incorporate changes from https://github.com/elidickinson/jquery-domwindow
- Check if draggable was applied to div before removing it
- Style changes: tabs are now two spaces, other stylistic changes
